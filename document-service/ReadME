This is sample application to assist a Bank with its Document Management System.

Basic core rest api has been done which are functional requirements for this application.
Tools used so far - Java Spring, rest apis, using Gradle as build tool and h2 in memory database.

Note - To execute basic core apis, kindly follow "PDF-Document-Endpoints-Steps.docx" under project directory.

It may take couple of more days to integrate 3rd party api for below requirements.
-  Feign api on top of rest call between microservices.
-  Retry and fallback logic for integration with 3rd party system with circuit breaker or resilience4j open api.

Note - Post and comment apis have been added in document-service but after integration of aforementioned
        open apis these endpoints will move in separate microservice.

Note - There are many queries came up while implementing core buisness apis which took time and may be
        while implementing integration with 3rd party may came up other queries as well.

Note - Some more points need to be added in requirement description as below and so on.
        eg. - H2 is in memory database so once application restart again h2 database got refresh.
            In case table having no entry but uploaded files are there that should also be deleted
            once application restart again.
